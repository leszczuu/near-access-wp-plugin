    <h2>NEAR Access</h2>
    <p>Thank you for downloading our plugin for NEAR Access.</p>
    <p>This plugin is to be used for allowing content for end-users with certain tokens accesses through the near network.</p>
    <p>Now that you have installed the plugin and activated it, all you need to do next is connect your token addresses in the settings tab below by pasting in your contract address.  Then you will see in each post/page the option to limit that content to people who hold those tokens.</p>
    <p>It is that easy.  The stack's network will do the rest by forcing the end-user to authenticate by a wallet then if the token matches the contract it will allow passage to the content.</p>
    <p>If the token does not exist they will be redirected to a page you created natively in WordPress and selected in the settings.</p>
    <p>Please feel free to email us if you need any help or would like any features/updates.</p>
